As a Deputy Registrar with 17 years of experience in Nigeria’s higher education sector, I’ve launched a research initiative titled:

**“ICT-Driven Records Management and the Digital Skills Gap Among Administrative Staff in Nigerian Polytechnics.”**

> This project explores how well administrative staff are equipped to use digital tools for records management. It adopts a case study approach and aims to identify training gaps and best practices.

**Abstract:**
