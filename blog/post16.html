  <p>As <strong>Nigeria</strong> celebrates her <strong>65th Independence Anniversary</strong> today, the message from the Commander-in-Chief could not be clearer: <strong>hope is alive</strong>, and the spirit of the Nigerian people remains unbreakable.</p>

  <p>In a powerful nationwide broadcast, President <strong>Bola Ahmed Tinubu</strong> urged citizens to look beyond their differences and build a country worthy of the dreams of those who fought for independence in 1960. “Our diversity is not our weakness — it is our greatest strength,” he declared.</p>

  <h2>🌍 Reflecting on 65 Years of Nationhood</h2>
  <p>On October 1, 1960, the green and white flag was raised for the first time — a moment that symbolized freedom, resilience, and destiny. Sixty-five years later, the journey has been marked by triumphs and challenges alike, from democratic milestones to economic battles.</p>

  <p>President Tinubu acknowledged the difficulties Nigerians face today, from rising living costs to insecurity, but emphasized that the “Nigerian story is still being written — and its best chapters are ahead.”</p>

  <h2>🤝 Unity Above All</h2>
  <p>“We must come together — not as tribes, not as regions, not as religions — but as one people with one destiny,” Tinubu said. He called on youth, business leaders, and political actors to work hand-in-hand to build a stronger, more prosperous nation.</p>

  <h2>💡 A New Era of Possibility</h2>
  <p>From digital innovation to education and renewable energy, Nigeria’s potential remains vast. As Africa’s largest democracy and economy, the country’s influence on the global stage continues to grow — and its people, known for their ingenuity and resilience, are leading that transformation.</p>

  <p>On this Independence Day, as the green and white flag waves proudly, one truth resonates from Lagos to Maiduguri, Kano to Port Harcourt: <strong>we are stronger together</strong>.</p>
