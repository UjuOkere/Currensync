  <p>There’s some financial relief in the air for federal government workers across Nigeria as June 2025 salaries have started dropping — at least for some. Employees enrolled under the <strong>Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS)</strong> have begun receiving their monthly wages as of this evening.</p>

  <p>According to credible sources within the Budget Office, <strong>personnel warrants have officially been released</strong> to all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), giving them the green light to process salary payments. Workers under the <strong>GIFMIS platform</strong> can expect to receive their salaries within the next 24 hours, barring any technical delays.</p>

  <p>The news has sparked excitement across MDAs, especially after weeks of uncertainty over delayed salary approvals. One senior officer who preferred anonymity said, “At least this time, it didn’t drag into the second week. Hopefully this becomes the new normal.”</p>

  <div class="ads">
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:block"
         data-ad-client="ca-pub-6539693262305451"
         data-ad-slot="8720273670"
         data-ad-format="auto"
         data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
    <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
  </div>

  <p>This update brings much-needed reassurance to civil servants nationwide. The federal government has been under pressure in recent months over delays in salary disbursements, prompting union demands for better transparency and timeliness.</p>

  <p>We’ll continue to monitor the rollout of the GIFMIS salaries and provide updates as soon as payments begin to reflect.</p>
